# RaindropCentral Plugin Suite

RaindropCentral is a multi-module Minecraft server platform produced by Antimatter Zone LLC. The repository ships a family of Bukkit/Paper plugins that share infrastructure for dependency loading, asynchronous services, and command discovery. This document introduces each module, how it boots, and which components are responsible for their runtime lifecycle.

## Repository Layout

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`RCore`](RCore/) | Core services shared by the ecosystem including database repositories, metrics, and the `RCoreService` API. |
| [`RDQ`](RDQ/) | RaindropQuests gameplay plugin with free and premium editions layered on a shared quest/bounty engine. |
| [`RPlatform`](RPlatform/) | Platform bootstrapper that provides logging, metrics, placeholders, database access, and scheduler adapters for every plugin. |
| [`JExDependency`](JExDependency/) | Runtime dependency loader that injects shaded libraries and remaps classes when Paper's plugin loader is active. |
| [`JExCommand`](JExCommand/) | Annotation-driven command and listener discovery used across RCore and RDQ. |
| [`JExEconomy`](JExEconomy/) | Multi-currency economy services and developer APIs (utility module consumed by other products). |
| [`JExTranslate`](JExTranslate/) | Internationalization tooling and MiniMessage-friendly translation manager. |

All Gradle modules are wired so the root build generates three distributable jars: `RCore.jar`, `RDQ-Free.jar`, and `RDQ-Premium.jar`.

## Common Bootstrap Pieces

### Runtime dependency loader (`JEDependency`)

Every plugin entrypoint calls `JEDependency.initializeWithRemapping(...)` during `onLoad`. The loader detects the server type, optionally injects libraries that Paper pre-downloads, and prefers the remapping manager when available. When remapping cannot be used, it falls back to the standard `DependencyManager` before logging completion.【F:JExDependency/src/main/java/de/jexcellence/dependency/JEDependency.java†L22-L110】

### Shared platform (`RPlatform`)

`RPlatform` wraps environment detection, async scheduling, logging, translations, and database bootstrap logic. `initialize()` runs asynchronously, creates the plugin data folders, copies `database/hibernate.properties`, and opens a JPA `EntityManagerFactory`. Additional opt-in hooks configure bStats metrics, PlaceholderAPI integration, and premium-resource detection, while `shutdown()` tears down placeholder hooks and closes resources.【F:RPlatform/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rplatform/RPlatform.java†L16-L143】【F:RPlatform/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rplatform/RPlatform.java†L145-L193】

### Command discovery (`CommandFactory`)

`CommandFactory` scans the plugin classloader for classes inside `command` and `listener` packages, instantiates annotated commands, and injects either the plugin instance or an edition-specific context object. Command metadata is loaded from YAML sections (e.g., `commands/<Command>.yml`), and listeners are registered automatically when they implement `Listener`. This factory underpins both RCore and RDQ command registrations.【F:JExCommand/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/commands/CommandFactory.java†L18-L131】

## Module Lifecycle Summaries

### RCore (Free & Premium)

Both `RCoreFree` and `RCorePremium` extend `JavaPlugin`. On load they initialize runtime dependencies, reflectively construct their `RCore*Impl`, and delegate lifecycle callbacks. Failed loads disable the plugin during `onEnable` to avoid inconsistent state.【F:RCore/rcore-free/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/core/RCoreFree.java†L1-L41】【F:RCore/rcore-premium/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/core/RCorePremium.java†L1-L41】

`RCoreFreeImpl` registers the shared `RCoreService` API during `onLoad`, then orchestrates asynchronous startup when enabled: it waits for `RPlatform.initialize()`, wires commands, repositories, supported plugin detection, and server registration before emitting the ASCII-art banner. Metrics service ID `25809` is used for bStats, and lifecycle failures disable the plugin safely.【F:RCore/rcore-free/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/core/RCoreFreeImpl.java†L1-L126】

`RCorePremiumImpl` follows a similar pattern but defers service registration until after repositories and integrations are ready. It builds repositories from the platform's `EntityManagerFactory`, inspects optional plugin hooks, registers `RCoreService` with higher priority, and records the current server in the database. Shutdown un-registers Bukkit services and closes executors.【F:RCore/rcore-premium/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/core/RCorePremiumImpl.java†L1-L166】【F:RCore/rcore-premium/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/core/RCorePremiumImpl.java†L200-L249】

### RDQ (Free & Premium)

`RDQFree` and `RDQPremium` perform the same dependency bootstrap and delegate to their edition implementations. If the implementation fails to load, `onEnable` logs an error and disables the plugin to protect servers from partial initialization.【F:RDQ/rdq-free/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/RDQFree.java†L1-L46】【F:RDQ/rdq-premium/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/RDQPremium.java†L1-L47】

Both variants wrap a shared `RDQ` engine. The abstract base initializes the `RPlatform`, command framework, Inventory Framework views, bounty/rank repositories, and metrics before registering services. Enable sequences run asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread and cancel safely during shutdown.【F:RDQ/rdq-common/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/RDQ.java†L1-L157】【F:RDQ/rdq-common/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/RDQ.java†L159-L234】

`RDQFreeImpl` provisions a lightweight `RDQManager`, limits bounty functionality, and keeps startup metrics under service ID `25810`. `RDQPremiumImpl` wires premium persistence providers, exposes a full-featured `PremiumBountyService`, and registers it in Bukkit's `ServicesManager` with `ServicePriority.High`. Both editions log ASCII banners reflecting available systems.【F:RDQ/rdq-free/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/RDQFreeImpl.java†L1-L104】【F:RDQ/rdq-premium/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/RDQPremiumImpl.java†L1-L132】

### Supporting Libraries

- **JExEconomy** – Provides an extendable economy service; consult module-specific docs when integrating with RDQ rewards or RCore stats.
- **JExTranslate** – Ships translation managers and MiniMessage utilities, used by `RPlatform` and example plugins.

## Security, Logging, and Observability

- **CentralLogger-first diagnostics** – All modules route logs through `RPlatform`'s `CentralLogger`, writing to structured log files while allowing console mirroring to be toggled for development. Sensitive identifiers (player UUIDs) must be hashed or aliased before reaching INFO/WARN logs.【F:RPlatform/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rplatform/logging/CentralLogger.java†L34-L347】
- **Perk audit trails** – RDQ exposes `PerkAuditService`, emitting JSON records that capture action, outcome, sanitized context, and hashed player fingerprints. Context keys are sanitized and truncated to prevent log injection while maintaining security analytics value.【F:RDQ/rdq-common/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/perk/runtime/PerkAuditService.java†L32-L212】
- **Log throttling** – High-volume error paths (e.g., repeated perk activation failures) apply sliding-window throttling to guard against log flooding or attacker-induced disk churn.【F:RDQ/rdq-common/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/perk/runtime/DefaultPerkRegistry.java†L231-L365】【F:RDQ/rdq-common/src/main/java/com/raindropcentral/rdq/perk/runtime/DefaultPerkTriggerService.java†L24-L110】

## Building & Testing

The project uses Gradle with the Wrapper committed. Typical commands:

```bash
./gradlew clean build    # Compile all modules, run tests, and produce plugin jars
./gradlew :RCore:build   # Build only the RCore module
./gradlew :RDQ:build     # Build RDQ variants
```

Run these commands from the repository root after making changes. For full verification, follow up with integration tests or Windows-specific packaging via `build-all.bat` if required by your workflow.

### Containerized build pipeline

The repository also ships a Docker-based builder that mirrors the Windows batch process. The image layers the Gradle sources onto an Eclipse Temurin JDK 21 base, installs `curl` and `git`, and then invokes `scripts/docker-build.sh` to prepare Maven-local dependencies, build the shaded jars, and copy them into an artifact directory. The script exits early when `RCore-Premium-<version>.jar`, `RDQ-Free-<version>.jar`, `RDQ-Premium-<version>.jar`, and `JExEconomy-<version>.jar` already exist in the target location, avoiding unnecessary rebuilds.【F:Dockerfile†L1-L30】【F:scripts/docker-build.sh†L1-L142】

Set the following environment variables when authenticated GitHub access is required (they are optional for public dependencies):

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_FINE_GRAIN_TOKEN` | Fine-grained personal access token used for cloning private dependencies. |
| `ARTIFACT_DEST` | Destination folder for the generated jars (defaults to `/artifacts`). |

#### Building artifacts with `docker build`

Use BuildKit's `--output` flag against the `builder` stage to emit jars into a local directory:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build \
  --target builder \
  --output type=local,dest=./dist \
  --build-arg GITHUB_FINE_GRAIN_TOKEN="ghp_exampletoken" \
  .
```

The build stage writes artifacts to `/artifacts` inside the container; `--output` maps that directory to the host `./dist` folder. Omit or adjust the GitHub arguments when public dependencies are sufficient.

#### Rebuilding with `docker run`

To perform incremental builds without rebuilding the image, first create the runtime image and then run it with a mounted volume:

```bash
docker build -t raindropcentral-builder .
docker run --rm \
  -e GITHUB_FINE_GRAIN_TOKEN="ghp_exampletoken" \
  -e ARTIFACT_DEST=/artifacts \
  -v "$(pwd)/dist:/artifacts" \
  raindropcentral-builder
```

The container reuses `scripts/docker-build.sh`, so reruns skip compilation when all expected jar names already exist in the mounted directory. Supply `ARTIFACT_DEST` if you prefer a different mount point inside the container.

## Next Steps

- Review module-specific READMEs (where present) for configuration details.
- Explore `commands/` and `database/` folders inside each plugin jar to understand runtime resources packaged alongside the code.
- Consult maintainers before altering dependency rules defined by `JEDependency` to avoid breaking runtime shading.
